            <h3 class="para1">All in all, art is universal and can be found everywhere. It is not only for people who exercise
                work art but for those who consume it. If there were no art, we wouldn't have been able to see
                the beauty in things. In other words, art helps us feel relaxed and forget about our problems.</h3>
            <h3 class="para2">Art gives meaning to our lives and helps us understand our world. It is an essential part of our
                culture because it allows us to have a deeper understanding of our emotions; it increases our
                self-awareness, and also allows us to be open to new ideas and experiences.</h3>
