            Digital creation, an essential future of art: It will most likely
            continue to determine part of the future of art. Just as the paint
            tube gave birth to Impressionism, the computer (and today
            smartphones and tablets) open up immense creative possibilities.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Creative arts are a form of expression not bound by language. They
          involve skill, imagination, and inspiration. The creative arts have
          been around for centuries. They are often associated with the human
          mind and creativity.he world has been experiencing an unprecedented
          acceleration of globalization for several decades. This translates
          into access to culture, economy, industry, information, on a global
          scale. Thus, an artist like Cindy Sherman, who has portrayed herself
          in self-portraits for more than 40 years, can grasp stereotypes from
          all over the world. She represents herself as an American housewife of
          the 1950s, as a Japanese theater actress, and many more characters.
          It pays tribute to the pioneers of Malian photography, such as Seydou Keita or
          Malick Sidibé. He takes the clothing customs of his country, such as
          the veil, and makes it an offbeat fashion accessory. He seizes local
          consumer products and he plays with the excessive display of
          counterfeit luxury brands. In doing so, his work fits into a
          globalized logic, but through a non-Westernized prism. If certain
          future artistic developments are already perceptible, we can also
          discern some dissonances.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          From the beginning, man has always had the impulse to create. But apparently, creation for the sake of mere utility did not satisfy him. And so, he embarked upon an eternal quest for beauty- creating things for sheer mental pleasure. And thus, Art was born. Perhaps this propensity to create, to innovate and drift away from the conventional and mundane is ingrained in us. Or in other words we can say that the Creator has blessed each one of us with a creative faculty; i.e., to create and to appreciate creation. God has made each one of us an Artist; maybe some more gifted than others, but the fundamental quality of an artist is present in each and every one of us- the quest for Beauty. One needs only to realize and acknowledge this fact.Who is it then, who tells you what is beautiful and what is ugly-looking, who guides you through your selection of matching dresses or jewellery, the colour, the style, the genre, the context, and the infinite shades and variants thereof, who teaches you to adorn your living room with art-pieces and paintings and wall colour and appropriate furniture, who prompts you to beautify your body with cosmetics and hairstyles and grooming, to tattoos, piercings, designer stubbles etc, and who makes you feel attracted towards good looking people, or for that matter, any beautiful thing? It is the Artist within you.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">My Journey of learning Art</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Everyone during their adolescence has been asked the question of what are you going to do for your future? For me, I’ve tried for the longest time to avoid this question. I’m not sure what I wanted to do for my future. During my freshman year in high school, my guidence counselor asked this question to me. It petrified me. I was a small freshmen, who barely knew where my classes were, let alone what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I didn’t even know what I was having for dinner that night, how was I supposed to plan out what I did for the rest of my life? I was at a lost. As Junior year came to a streaking beginning, I knew it was time to actually start thinking about my journey into my future.</p>
          <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">I made a list of things I enjoyed doing. Writing, reading, drawing, video games, and being a superfan for things I’ve enjoyed throughout the years. It took me awhile but, I realised what all these things have in common. That is writing stories, and drawing things. In the summer of 2012, I was an extremely shy child . I had only had a couple of friends and never really ventured out to make new friends. So, for the majority of that summer I kept to myself, and read the Twilight Saga. During my readings of the Twilight Saga, I became a major fan of the series. This was my very first ‘fandom’, of a long line that will soon come in the upcoming years. I was introduced to Tumblr, where all fan geeks like me gathered to share our feelings on books, music, and art that we liked. Through Tumblr, I was introduced fanfiction and fanart. This was how I got into drawing.
